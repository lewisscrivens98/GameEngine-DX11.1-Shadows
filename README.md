# GameEngine - DX11.1 - Version 2

A DirectX 11.1 Game Engine created for my second term assignment in Game Engine Architecture
at The University of Huddersfield.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This engine will be an improvement on my first term game engine. I am going to be focusing on shader driven effects, particle effects, lighting and shadows.
