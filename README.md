# GameEngine - DX11.1 - Version 2

An improved DirectX 11.1 Game Engine from my second term assignment in Game Engine Architecture at The University of Huddersfield.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This engine will be an improvement on my first term game engine. I am going to be focusing on shader driven effects, particle effects, lighting and shadows.

Some of the engine features I will include will be derived from the tutorials found here: http://www.rastertek.com
